Origins, evolution, and effects of the cosmic magnetic field on structure formation in the universe are among pressing questions in astrophysics and cosmology.  [School of Astronomy (SoA)](https://astro.ipm.ac.ir/) at [Institute of Research in Fundamental Sciences (IPM)](https://www.ipm.ir/) hosts researchers who are actively involved in both observational and theoretical studies of cosmic magnetism on various scales. For a better understanding of the subject it is very insightful to connect theoreticians with observers. The **Cosmic Magnetism Group (CMG)** is hence created to define collaborative projects.

Cosmic Magnetism Group Meeting (CMGM) is the monthly meetings of the CMG to

1- define and progress collaborative projects

2- present the latest findings in the field through journal clubs and free discussions

3- host talks from famous external and international scientists in the field

**Meetings:**

CMGMs are held (*either in-person or hybrid*) on  **Sundays**, *typically on the first Sunday of each month*, at around **10 A.M.** (GMT+03:30) Iran Time in the SoA Seminar Room.
