### Talk
####  Dr. Asiyeh Yaghoobi (IPM)
**27 August 2024**

- **Title:** The Role of the Magnetic Field in the Growth of Rayleigh–Taylor Instability

- **Abstract:** In this talk, we will explore one of the most important instabilities in astrophysics, known as the Rayleigh–Taylor instability, which occurs in both terrestrial and astrophysical systems. We will then focus on the linear analysis of this instability in the presence of a magnetic field and examine how the magnetic field influences its growth and the formation of astrophysical structures.
