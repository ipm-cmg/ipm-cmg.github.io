**Meeting Summary:**

At the beginning of the meeting, we arranged the chairs in a circle to create a more friendly and inclusive atmosphere. Each member then gave a short presentation on their interests, knowledge and research expereinces on the topic of MF in the sky.

- Amir Yarahmadi: 
    - Working on the magnetic field in galaxy M31 (Currently engaged in data cleaning).
    - His idea: examining the effect of magnetic fields on star formation.
    - Amir and his supervisor (Fatemeh) believe that magnetic fields act against star formation.
    - Wants to learn more about:
    	1. The origins of primordial magnetic fields: Where did they come from?
    	2. Processes that amplify these initial fields (curious about the dynamo process, its effectiveness, and the redshift at which it occurs).
    	3. Processes of flux freezing and their global and local impacts.
    - Interested in testing QFT in observations and believes cosmic magnetic fields offer significant insights in this area.

- Hamidreza Mahani: 
    - An enthusiast and expert in synthesizing star-forming populations.
    - Wishes to study the impact of magnetic fields on the initial mass function (IMF) of stars.
    - He thinks magnetic fields have a non-obvious effect on the IMF, similar to initial condition effects in chaotic physical systems like weather patterns.

- Alireza Karamzadeh: 
	- A master's student from Shahid Beheshti University. 
	- Interested in learning more about the origin of cosmic magnetic fields.

- Haidar Sheikhahmadi: 
    - Specializes in studying the effects of magnetic fields on space-time metrics.
    - Has studied changes in Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics in the presence of FORCE FREE FIELD.
    - Interested in the possibility of generating magnetic fields with very large coherence lengths through quantum field theory.
    - Currently working on a project to investigate magnetic fields within voids using simple electrodynamics equations.

- Ebrahim Yousefi:
    - Eager to study the interplay between magnetic fields within voids and the evolution of voids.

- Mohammad Hossein Jalali: 
    - Keen to simulate large-scale structures in the presence of magnetic fields.
    - Interested in how to trace magnetic fields using stochastic fields with morphological tools.
    - Wants to study the effect of magnetic fields on galaxy clustering.
    
- Hedieh Abdollahi:
    - Curious about the effect of magnetic fields on galaxy quenching and star formation.
    - Interested in the quenching effect.

- Fatemeh Tabatabaei:
    - Investigating the role of magnetic fields on star formation and galaxy evolution.
    - Interested in the back-reaction of magnetic fields.
    - Wants to study small-scale dynamo: believes that the conversion of turbulent energy to magnetic energy is effective only up to certain scales. Star formation rates in galaxy centers decrease with increasing magnetic field strength.
    - Aims to focus on the effects of ram pressure, secular evolution, and quenching to address open questions in this field.
    
- Arash Danesh:
    - Discussed the observatory program and its potential collaboration in magnetic field observations.
    - Mentioned the need for a polarimeter at the observatory to capture polarized waves and gather magnetic field data.
    - Shared valuable insights on outreach activities and scientific communication, emphasizing how these efforts can advance the group's scientific progress.
    
Following Arash's remarks, Dr. Tabatabaei provided educational points on the possibility of observing magnetic fields using radio and optical telescopes. She explained how synchrotron radiation is emitted by electrons spiraling in a magnetic field, and highlighted the challenge posed by dust particles in optical telescopes that can polarize electromagnetic waves, complicating the detection of magnetic fields.

- Hassan Firouzjahi:
    - Has significant research experience in generating primordial magnetic fields in inflationary models.
    - Interested in understanding how an observer can detect magnetic fields in the sky.
    - From a theoretical perspective, he wants to learn about the evolution of magnetic fields in material environments post-Big Bang.

- Asieh Yaghubi:
    
    - Focused on the formation of star clusters and solving hydrodynamic equations through simulations.
    - Interested in the impact of magnetic fields on the IMF of galaxies and clusters, specifically on second-generation star formation and the formation of massive stars.
    - Concerned about the limitations of current simulation codes, particularly in resolution, and wants to understand the assumptions behind these codes and when they need to be developed further. Overall, she is keen on developing numerical methods and simulations for solving MHD equations.
    - Familiar with the RAMSES code for astrophysical simulations and wants to conduct cosmological simulations on much larger scales.
    
**Summary:**

Overall, the interests of the group members can be categorized into three main areas:

    1. Observational Research
    2. Theoretical Research
    3. Development of Numerical Methods and Simulations
    
At the end of the meeting, it was agreed that researchers from either the theoretical or observational sections could give short educational talks on their specialized topics if they wish. This would enhance group coherence and foster more valuable discussions and questions, thereby improving the group's scientific environment.
Additionally, it was decided that future monthly meetings will be held at 10 AM on Sundays, typically on the first Sunday of each month, to accommodate Dr. Rezaei, a researcher interested in cosmic magnetic fields, ensuring his participation.

**Next Meeting:**

It was decided that future monthly meetings will be held on Sundays to accommodate [Dr. Rezaei](https://sina.sharif.edu/~reza.rezaei/)'s schedule.
