### Free Discussion
####  Biot-Savart Law in Cosmic Scales
**1 October 2024**

- **Title:** Biot-Savart Law in Cosmic Scales

- **Abstract:** In this meeting, we discussed magnetic fields generated via possible cosmic net currents from galaxies and filaments. Heidar and Alireza presented notes and codes on the Biot-Savart Law and its potential applications on cosmic scales. Heidar discussed how a configuration of a current loop might be applicable to an AGN galaxy and/or large-scale filaments.

Some interesting questions arose from the audience in this direction. In a private report, the questions and possible directions on this topic will be shared with the attendees.

in the SoA classroom on the 2nd floor of the SoA building.

I’m excited to see everyone who is passionate about magnetic fields in the cosmos!
