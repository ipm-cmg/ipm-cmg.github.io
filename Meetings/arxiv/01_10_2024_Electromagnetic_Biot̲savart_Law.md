### Free Discussion
####  Electromagnetic Biot-Savart Law
**1 October 2024**

- **Title:** Electromagnetic Biot-Savart Law

- **Abstract:** In this meeting, we discussed magnetic fields generated via possible cosmic net currents from galaxies and filaments. Heidar and Alireza presented notes and codes on the Biot-Savart Law and its potential applications on cosmic scales. Heidar discussed how a configuration of a current loop might be applicable to an AGN galaxy and/or large-scale filaments.

Some interesting questions arose from the audience in this direction. In a private report, the questions and possible directions on this topic will be shared with the attendees.
